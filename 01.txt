Here is the procedure:

# vi /etc/squid/deny_websites
.yahoo.com
.google.com
.whatever.com

wq:

# vi /etc/squid/squid.conf

acl deny_websites dstdomain “/etc/squid/deny_websites”
http_access deny deny_websites

Save and close the file. Restart Squid:
# service squid restart

Let us say you would like to deny access for anyone who browses to a URL
with the word “bar” in it. Append following ACL:
acl blockregexurl url_regex -i bar
http_access deny blockregexurl
